                <h3>Written Questions</h3>
                <br>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The first bar graph addresses the 1st question by 
                        showing the number of games per year from 2020 down to 2011. The second graph, the map, 
                        shows the top 10 winning nations and you can hover over the blue countries to see their
                        winning %. The third graph, the lollipop chart, incorporates the toggle button and predicts
                        which team will win the 2022 World Cup based on data from the past two world cups (2018 and 2014)
                        based on first Winning % out of those 2 World Cups or Victory Strength (how much the winner won by 
                        for each of the past 2 World Cup tournament games). The prediction shows as the title of the graph.
                        I chose these two metrics because we should bet on teams that have won most of their games in the past
                        as that shows a good performance record and a higher victory strength means they didn't just barely
                        win by chance but are actually a better team.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        D3 was helpful because it allowed me to express the data in a geographical way 
                        on the map, which is visually beneficial. Also, the hover function allowed me to express
                        the winning % information without cluttering the map area by showing it all at once.
                        Thirdly, the toggle button function helped to visually see the direct change in the World Cup
                        winner prediction based on the two different metrics and it's easy to toggle back and 
                        forth for comparison.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        D3 would not be the best tool for creating a visualization if the visualization creator
                        is not well-versed in coding and needs a quick and easy way to visualize data. That's where
                        something like Tableau would be better since it still represents data in numerical and organized
                        graphs but you don't have to build everything from the ground up in a complex manner. Another 
                        reason you wouldn't use D3 is if you have many SVG elements needed to show your data. Creating 
                        the js and html code to account for all those graphs would be very painstaking and inefficient.
                        Finally, D3 wouldn't be the best tool if the target audience learns better through audio or some other
                        form of information platform that doesn't rely as heavily on just one human sense. For example, showing
                        video or more complicated multimedia components as part of the data would be hard through D3.

                    <h4>Accessible Data Visualization</h4>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Users who have full visual ability and digest visual information well would find this
                        dashboard accessbile. As referenced in "A Comprehensive Guide to Accessible Data Visualization", 
                        color blind or blind users may find visual dashboards more difficult to 
                        use. I chose the blue color for the map off of the color blind friendly website, but I 
                        could do that for all the colors in my graphs to make sure none of the graphs are harder 
                        to see than others. The article also provides color contrast guidelines to ensure better legibility 
                        for users which I could incorporate. Both articles also reference assistive technology, such as 
                        a screen reader which only reads the text on the screen, which means my hover feature for the map 
                        would be hidden for certain users. I could add the hover information somewhere on the side of the 
                        map on the screen in addition to the hover feature so that users with screen readers can still get
                        all the necessary information off the visualization.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I could have added the hover information on the side of the map when I was implementing the hover
                        feature. I didn't do so because I didn't know about users with screen readers and how the hover information
                        would be hidden from them, but now I know! I also could have checked the other colors in my graph
                        when I was using the color blind friendly blue color from the website. I wasn't sure how to implement
                        the scale of colors using color blind friendly colors for the first graph, so I didn't go forward with it
                        but I definitely will try next time.
